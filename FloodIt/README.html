<h2 id="project-flood-it">Project: Flood It</h2>
<p>&quot;Flood It&quot; is a coloring game played on a square board of colored tiles. At each move, the player selects a color (by clicking on one of the tiles) and the tile in the upper left corner, as well as all connected neighboring tiles of the same color, are changed to the selected color. The objective of the game is end up with all the tiles being the same color while minimizing the number of moves.</p>
<p>If you haven't played &quot;Flood It&quot; before, please spend some time playing the game so that you can develop an intuition for how it works and formulate strategies for game play before trying to implement anything. There is an online version at http://unixpapa.com/floodit.</p>
<h2 id="your-task">Your Task</h2>
<p>We have written most of the game but we need your help in finishing it. We would like you to write the <code>flood</code> function in the <code>Flood</code> class. The <code>flood</code> function takes four parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>color</code> - the color that the play just selected. It is an instance of the <code>WaterColor</code> enum.</p></li>
<li><p><code>flooded_list</code> - a <code>LinkedList</code> of coordinates for all of the tiles in the current flooded region.</p></li>
<li><p><code>tiles</code> - a two dimensional array of tiles (instances of <code>Tile</code>), so <code>tiles[y][x]</code> accesses the tile at the specified x and y coordinate. The x coordinate increase as you go to the right and the y coordinate increase as you go down. The purpose of this parameter is to give you access to the color of a tile, which can be obtained using the <code>getColor()</code> method.</p></li>
<li><p><code>board_size</code>: the number of rows of tiles in the board. (The number of columns is the same as the number of rows, so the board is square.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You are to add the new flooded tiles to the <code>flooded_list</code>. The <code>flooded_list</code> initially contains the tile at the upper left corner. You are not responsible for changing the color of any tiles.</p>
<p>We say that a tile neighbors another tile if it is directly above, below, left, or right, that is, sharing a side with the other one. The <code>Coord</code> class contains some helpful functions: the functions named <code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code> compute the coordinates of the adjacent tiles; the function <code>onBoard</code> tells you whether a coordinate is on the board, and <code>neightbors</code> returns a list of neighboring coordinates.</p>
<p>An X-colored region is a set of tiles defined as follows: * A tile of color X is an X-colored region. * If tile <span class="math"><em>T</em></span> is color X and adjacent to a tile in an X-colored region R, then the union of T and R is an X-colored region.</p>
<p>Given a <code>flooded_list</code> whose tiles are of color X, the <code>flood</code> function should add every X-colored region to the <code>flooded_list</code>, provided the region contains a tile that is adjacent to a tile in the <code>flooded_list</code>.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>After implementing and debugging your <code>flood</code> function, run the game in batch timing mode by adding <code>timing</code> to the program arguments in the run configuration window. This will display a graph of the execution time (along the y-axis) versus the number of tiles on the board (along the x-axis) and it will save the graph to png file named <code>result.png</code>. Look at the graph. What function (roughly) fits that graph? (Hint: possibilities to think about are f(n) = n, f(n) = n^2, f(n) = n log(n).) What is the time complexity of your <code>flood</code> function based on analyzing the code in your <code>flood</code> function? Does your analysis match up with what you see in the graph? If not, double check your analysis. Is the time complexity of your <code>flood</code> function the best it can be or can you do better?</p>
<p>Try to improve the time complexity of your flood function. Write new flood functions <code>flood1</code>, <code>flood2</code>, etc. whose execution time does not grow so quickly as the number of tiles increases. When you re-run in batch mode, the timings for these alternate functions will show up as gray lines. Swap the names of your versions of <code>flood</code> so that your best version is named <code>flood</code> (so it will be the version used interactively). Re-run the timing, producing a graph with the best version highlighted in red. What is the time complexity of your new version?</p>
<p>If your code is so slow that no graph is produced when running in batch mode, try temporarily reducing the value of Constants.MAX_BOARD_SIZE_FOR_AUTOPLAY. For each board size, the game is repeated 5 times to reduce the effect of noise. Turning down the Constants.NUM_GAMES_TO_AUTOPLAY parameter may save you time during development.</p>
<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<p>Make sure that your project compiles and runs correctly and that your answers regarding the time complexity of <code>flood</code> and <code>flood1</code> are written in a comment above those functions.</p>
<p>Submit the files <code>Flood.java</code>, <code>results.png</code>, and <code>README.md</code> (with answers to the questions above) to the autograder.</p>
